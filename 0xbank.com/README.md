0xbank is a centralized way to safely store de-centralized data.

It stores a keystore file in two parts： One is a Key, the other is a Cryptographic seeds. Only when both parts are correctly obtained and put together (make a keystore file). You must use the correct password to use it.


# first step

## The Vulnerability of Ethereum's Account
As well known, Ethereum's accouts is a 20 digital(HEX) string, it comes from 256 bits of random numbers. Because of the characteristics of hashing operation, it will lead to the case that one address corresponds to multiple private keys.

I will create a web site (http://0xbank.com) to test the Ethereum's account's vulnerablilty. Anyone can crash an account address through a website page.

I will distribute all the funds of the account according to the contribution of everyone.

# second step

I will build a more secure and reliable account system for Bitcoin and Ethereum.ß
